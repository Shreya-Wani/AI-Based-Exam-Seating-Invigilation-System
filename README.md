## 📌 Problem Statement (#8)

> **Develop a scheduling system to assign students to exam halls while ensuring distancing rules, availability of invigilators, and subject conflicts are managed.**

### Key Features Implemented:
- 🪑 **Strict Sequential Hall Filling** — Fill Hall 1 completely before Hall 2
- 🧩 **Conflict Avoidance** — No students with common subjects in same hall (Graph Coloring Heuristic)
- 📅 **Exam Scheduling** — Topological Sort for subject dependencies
- 🔍 **Student Search** — String matching by name, roll, ID
- 📊 **Performance Analysis** — Time & Space Complexity, NP-Completeness Discussion
- 🎯 **Real College Scale** — Departments (CSE, IT, Civil...), Years (FY/SY/TY/LY), Divisions (A/B/C)

## ✅ Course Outcomes (COs) Covered

| CO | Description | Implementation |
|----|-------------|----------------|
| **CO-1** | Analyze time complexity | `O(n × m)` seating, `O(V + E)` scheduling, displayed in UI |
| **CO-2** | Recurrence relations | Discussed in NP-Completeness section (Graph Coloring → recurrence for coloring) |
| **CO-3** | Greedy / Dynamic Programming | **Greedy First-Fit Bin Packing** for seating allocation |
| **CO-4** | String Matching | Search by name, roll, ID using `.includes()` |
| **CO-5** | P vs NP / NP-Completeness | **Graph Coloring → NP-Complete** → Heuristic solution (fill halls sequentially) |
| **CO-6** | Graph Algorithms | **Topological Sort** for exam scheduling, DFS/BFS implied in conflict detection |

## 🧠 Algorithm Highlights

### 1. **Strict Sequential Hall Filling (Greedy First-Fit)**
```javascript
// Fill Hall_001 completely → then Hall_002 → then Hall_003...
for (const hall of sortedHalls) {
    // Phase 1: Assign without conflicts
    // Phase 2: Fill remaining seats (ignore conflicts if needed)
}
```

### 2. **Topological Sort for Exam Scheduling**
```javascript
// Schedule Math before Physics, DSA before DBMS, etc.
function topologicalSort(dependencies) { ... }
```

### 3. **NP-Completeness (Graph Coloring)**
> “Perfect conflict-free seating = Graph Coloring → NP-Complete → We use heuristic: fill halls sequentially, ignore conflicts if necessary.”

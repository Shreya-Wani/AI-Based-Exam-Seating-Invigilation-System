# 🎓 AI-Based Exam Seating & Invigilation System

> “Organizing exams shouldn’t be stressful — it should be smart.”  

The **AI-Based Exam Seating & Invigilation System** is a modern, fully responsive web interface designed to simplify how institutions manage exams.  
Built entirely using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, this system focuses on user experience, responsive behavior, and elegant design — transforming manual exam management into a smooth digital experience.  
The project is **deployed live** and can be accessed here: [Live Demo](https://ai-based-exam-seating-invigilation.vercel.app/).

## 🌍 The Idea Behind the Project

Every exam season brings the same set of challenges — seat arrangements, invigilator planning, and student data tracking.  
What if all of this could happen visually, instantly, and efficiently?  

That question led to this project — a smart interface where administrators can view, plan, and visualize the entire exam structure from a single dashboard.  
No spreadsheets, no paper — just an intelligent layout that adapts to every screen.

## 💡 Algorithms Used

The system implements **basic allocation and distribution logic** to ensure fair and efficient seating:

- **First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS):** Seats are initially assigned based on registration order to avoid conflicts.  
- **Greedy Allocation:** Ensures maximum utilization of available seats while keeping students from the same department distributed evenly.  
- **Conflict Checking:** Simple rule-based checks prevent two students from the same seat or exam hall at the same time.  

These algorithms run **on the frontend** to dynamically generate seat cards and handle adjustments in real time.

## 💫 Design & Behavior

The project follows a **responsive-first** design approach.  
Each section — whether it’s the Dashboard, Exam Schedule, or Allocate Seats — adjusts automatically to the user’s screen size.  

When viewed on large screens, cards align evenly in multiple columns.  
As the screen narrows, the cards gently resize, move to the center, and stack neatly, maintaining equal proportions.  
This ensures the layout never breaks and remains visually balanced across all devices.

Every button, card, and section is styled to match a **modern dark theme**, creating a professional and visually calm interface.  
Hover effects and soft shadows add interactivity, while centered text and consistent spacing make the experience intuitive.
